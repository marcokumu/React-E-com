## ELECTRONICS
This is an SPA (Single Page Application) that has been built with certain objectives in mind. Some of the objectives include:

    1. The user should be able to view different electronic products on the page.

    2. The user should be able to add items to the cart.

    3. The website should be consuming a json.server with my own data.

## LANGUAGES USED

    1.HTML

    2.CSS

    3.JAVASCRIPT (REACTjs)

## CHALLENGES FACED WHEN BUILDING THIS APP

- Entering my own data in the json.server was a long and tedious process.
